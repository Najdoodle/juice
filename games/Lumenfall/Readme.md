**How would you pitch your game in one line?** : **its inspired by limbo where you have to solve puzzles and interact with lighting.**

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?: The key mechanic in Lumenfall revolves around manipulating light sources to solve puzzles. 
Players can move objects, such as blocks or mirrors, to direct light beams and cast shadows that either reveal hidden paths or unlock doors.
The interaction between light and shadow creates a dynamic and immersive puzzle-solving experience. As the puzzles progress, 
more light sources and objects will be introduced, allowing for increasingly complex solutions and rewarding creative thinking.**


**How does the game actually play?** :**Players will navigate through dark, atmospheric levels where light is their primary tool to progress.
Each level will feature a puzzle that can be solved by moving objects to adjust light sources and manipulate shadows.
The goal is to uncover hidden pathways, unlock doors, or activate mechanisms by strategically positioning light and shadow.
Players are rewarded with a sense of discovery and accomplishment as they progress to increasingly complex puzzles.**

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** :
**To keep players engaged for 30 minutes, the game will gradually increase puzzle difficulty, adding new elements like multiple light sources, timed puzzles, and new objects to interact with.
The puzzles will be designed in such a way that each one feels like a unique challenge, with each solving method feeling rewarding and creative. 
As players progress, theyâ€™ll uncover more of the world, with ambient music and atmospheric visuals maintaining a mysterious and immersive experience.**
